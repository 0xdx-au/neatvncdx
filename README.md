# neatvncdx (patched for whodx)

## Introduction

This is a fork of the original [neatvnc](https://github.com/any1/neatvnc) project, maintained for secure integration within the [`whodx`](https://github.com/0xdx-au/whodx) hardened remote desktop platform.

> üéØ This version removes all H.264 encoding support to ensure compatibility, simplify builds, and maintain long-term reproducibility in Dockerized environments.

---

## Why This Fork?

The original upstream repository:
- Introduced `h264_encoder_create()`/`destroy()` logic without static linkage or proper wrap fallback
- Lacks stable tags or release versions
- Breaks reproducible builds due to dependency volatility

This fork:
- ‚úÖ **Removes** `have_working_h264_encoder()` and OpenH264 blocks in `src/server.c`
- ‚úÖ Ensures Meson/Ninja build **without FFmpeg**, H.264, or broken `libav*` dependencies
- ‚úÖ Is pinned and patched specifically for containerized headless deployment

---

## Goals
- ‚ö° Speed
- ‚ú® Clean interface
- üß± Hardened for ephemeral desktops in TOR/VNC isolation
- ‚ôªÔ∏è Reproducible builds (CI/CD-ready)
